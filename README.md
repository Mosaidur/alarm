Notes

The app follows the Figma design provided: Figma Link.
Clean architecture principles are followed with separation of concerns (UI, business logic, and data).
The app handles edge cases like permission denials and invalid inputs.
Local storage is implemented using shared_preferences for simplicity (optional feature).
